Test cases for  2-matrix_divided.py
===================================

This module has only one function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====
``matrix_divided()`` returns a new matrix with all elements divided by ``div``.


Importing function from the module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Test with valid matrix and divisor
    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Test with a matrix containing floats
    >>> matrix = [[1.0,2.0], [3.0,4.0]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0]]

Test with matrix contaning negative integers
    >>> matrix = [[-1,-2,-3], [-4,-5,-6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Test with single row matrix
    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5]]

Test with divisor of 0
    >>> matrix = [[1,2], [3,4]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
                   ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Test with float divisor
    >>> matrix = [[1,2], [3,4]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
    [[0.4, 0.8], [1.2, 1.6]]

Original matrix is left unchanged
    >>> matrix
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

Test with combination of floats and integers in the matrix
    >>> matrix = [[2,8.4], [3.9,7]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[1.0, 4.2], [1.95, 3.5]]

Test with integer and a string element in the matrix
    >>> matrix = [[2,"hello"], [4,6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
                   ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test with an empty list of list
    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[]]

Test for matrix that is not a list of lists
    >>> matrix = [2,4,8]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
                   ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
